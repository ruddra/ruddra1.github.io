<h2>Summary</h2>

I love to poke around dynamic and functional languages, and implement what I imagine or try to. I love developing software as long as its interesting and challenging. In my spare time I play video games, commute by cycle, or travel.

I am currently working as a software engineer at Progmaatic Developer Network. I have developed multiple web applications mostly about sales/distribution system and e-commerce using Django framework.

I hold a Bachelor of Science Degree on Computer Science and Engineering from Jahangirnagar University, Dhaka, Bangladesh.

Ultimately, my passion is to create innovative solutions for real-world problems. By learning new languages, developing skills in new domains and working with great people, I want to pursue my passion. Currently my skills are on Python, JavaScript etc., but I am looking forward to learning new things.
